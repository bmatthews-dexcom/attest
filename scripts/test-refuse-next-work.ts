/**
 * test-refuse-next-work.ts — Pass 18 chapter module for scripts/test.ts (T26.3).
 *
 * "Close-before-next-claim" protocol wiring, refuse-to-select-next-work half:
 *   1. openTicketFor()/`tickets.mjs open-for` — an actor with an open
 *      (claimed/in_progress) ticket is refused; one with none (or only an
 *      in_review ticket — already "closed" per T26.1) is not.
 *   2. `tickets.mjs claim` (both via the CLI and a DIRECT library import —
 *      the direct-import case is a regression test: an earlier version only
 *      wired the hygiene check into the CLI's `claim` handler, so importing
 *      `claim()` from the library bypassed it entirely) refuses to hand out
 *      a NEW ticket while the ticket graph itself is unhygienic (write-scope
 *      collision). `start` is proven NOT blocked by the same condition, since
 *      it only ever advances a ticket the actor already owns.
 *
 * The receipt-gate half (accept()'s manifest-receipt enforcement) lives in
 * test-close-receipt.ts (Pass 17) — split out to keep both files under the
 * file-size cap, matching test-gate-receipts.ts's precedent.
