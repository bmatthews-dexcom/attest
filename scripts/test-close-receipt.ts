/**
 * test-close-receipt.ts — Pass 16 chapter module for scripts/test.ts (T26.3).
 *
 * "Close-before-next-claim" protocol wiring:
 *   1. accept() refuses in_review -> done unless the module's Completion
 *      Manifest has the close() receipt pasted verbatim into it (not just a
 *      self-asserted "<id> done -- ..." phrase) — the planted acceptance
 *      test: "a HANDOFF completing without a close receipt must be rejected
 *      by the gate." Exercised both at the tickets.mjs library level AND
 *      through the real validate-close-receipt.sh script against its actual
 *      evals/fixtures/validators/validate-close-receipt/{red,green} fixture
 *      directories, so the rejection is proven to fire, not just documented.
 *   2. A hand-typed receipt that matches the header shape but not the
 *      recorded branch/commits evidence must not fool accept() (defeats the
 *      obvious bypass an independent reviewer would try first).
 *   3. start() returns a paste-able "start receipt" (Stage 0 of the /reflow
 *      claim HANDOFF template).
 *   4. openTicketFor()/`tickets.mjs open-for` — the refuse-to-select-
 *      next-work query: an actor with an open (claimed/in_progress) ticket
 *      is refused; one with none (or only an in_review ticket — already
 *      "closed" per T26.1) is not.
 *   5. `tickets.mjs claim` refuses when the ticket graph itself is
 *      unhygienic (write-scope collision) — the hygiene half of "refuse to
 *      select next work."
 *
 * Extracted to its own chapter module (rather than growing
 * test-ticket-lifecycle.ts further) to keep both files under the file-size
 * cap, matching test-gate-receipts.ts's precedent.
