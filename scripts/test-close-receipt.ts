/**
 * test-close-receipt.ts — Pass 17 chapter module for scripts/test.ts (T26.3).
 *
 * "Close-before-next-claim" protocol wiring, receipt-gate half:
 *   1. accept() refuses in_review -> done unless the module's Completion
 *      Manifest has the close() receipt pasted verbatim into it (not just a
 *      self-asserted "<id> done -- ..." phrase) — the planted acceptance
 *      test: "a HANDOFF completing without a close receipt must be rejected
 *      by the gate." Exercised both at the tickets.mjs library level AND
 *      through the real validate-close-receipt.sh script against its actual
 *      evals/fixtures/validators/validate-close-receipt/{red,green} fixture
 *      directories, so the rejection is proven to fire, not just documented.
 *   2. A hand-typed receipt that matches the header shape but not the
 *      recorded branch/commits/actor evidence must not fool accept() —
 *      defeats the obvious bypasses an independent reviewer tried first
 *      (wrong commit, and a fabricated `actor:` line with otherwise-correct
 *      evidence — the second one was a real gap found and closed here).
 *   3. start() returns a paste-able "start receipt" (Stage 0 of the /reflow
 *      claim HANDOFF template).
 *
 * The refuse-to-select-next-work half (openTicketFor/`open-for`, claim's
 * hygiene refusal) lives in test-refuse-next-work.ts (Pass 18) — split out
 * to keep both files under the file-size cap, matching test-gate-receipts.ts's
 * precedent.
