# waive-gate.sh -- explicit, human-signed waiver for a phase gate (T27.1).
#
# The ONLY way to make a phase gate "pass" without a real
# validate-phase-gate.sh run actually completing clean. Writes a receipt with
# mode "waiver" -- check_phase_prereq() in validate-phase-gate.sh accepts it,
# but only if --signed-by names an actual person (not "agent"/"claude"/"ai"/
# "system"/"bot"/"llm" etc).
#
# This exists so existing-project adoption (a phase's docs predate this
# tooling, or a phase genuinely doesn't apply) has a real path forward that
# ISN'T silent retroactive minting -- detect-sdlc-state.sh used to create
# fake "passed" locks just because a phase's files existed; that was the
# exact mechanism behind the 2026-07-07 ticket-hygiene incident. A waiver is
# the opposite of that: a distinct, visible, deliberately-named action that
# shows up in shell history and this script's own stderr banner, not
# something that happens as a side effect of routine scanning.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/waive-gate.sh <phase> "<reason>" --signed-by <name> [project-root]
#
# Example:
#   scripts/waive-gate.sh phase-2 "requirements docs predate SDLC tooling adoption, reconstructed from git history" --signed-by bmatthews

# Independent review (2026-07-07) found the original case-sensitive blocklist
# trivially bypassed by casing alone (AGENT/CLAUDE/aGeNt all slipped through,
# same for leading/trailing whitespace) — confirmed live, not theoretical.
# Normalize (trim + lowercase, POSIX tr/sed — bash 3.2 has no ${var,,}) before
# matching. This is a deterrent against a sloppy/eager agent signing its own
# waiver by accident (this program's actual threat model — see M27's stated
# non-goal: "not preventing a hostile agent"), not a security boundary against
# a determined adversary who could always invent an unlisted name; a
# comprehensive "is this really human" check is a different, harder problem.
